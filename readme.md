# Exploring animation in games

Animation in game development is hard. Data-driven animation is the best solution, but it is not always possible. It's painful when you have to store additional data for animation and mangle with it on every frame. That's probably why there is visual glitch in games.

This repository explores the common patterns of game animation and tries to solve them without storing additional state.

Some developer might have talked about this in GDC. Oh well.
